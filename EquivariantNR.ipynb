    "\n",
    "### 1.1: Intro\n",
    "The paper from Dupont et al. introduces an approach to render 2D images into implicit, equivariant 3D representations. The authors argue that the scene representations need not be explicit, as long as the transformations to it occur in an equivariant manner. Their model is trained on a dataset of rotation symmetries, learning to produce novel views from a single image of a scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current approaches in scene representations present difficulties with scalability. Voxel grids, point clouds and other traditional methods have high computational and memory requirements. Reconstrucion from incomplete or noisy data is also a challenging task with these methods, often requiring 3D information during training. Generating novel views of a scene given some input views presents the same difficulties. Finally, traditional neural networks are not equivariant with respect to general transformation groups. 3D equivariance especially requires specifc techniques like steerable filters. The authors attempt to solve these problems by proposing a new method which results in more scalable, implicit representations that are also equivariant with respect to transformations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between an explicit scene representation (mesh grid) and an implicit one can be seen in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](figg2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 1.2: Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed model uses a series of convolutions to map scene representations to images. Specifically, the scene representation is passed through 3D convolutions, followed by 1x1 convolutions and a set of 2D convolutions that maps them to image space. The reverse renderer is the transpose of this operation. Equivariance is enforced by applying transformations in both the scene and image spaces. Because the representation space is a deep voxel grid, the transformations in this space are defined by a 3D rotation matrix. Inverse warping with trilinear interpolation is also used in the model, to reconstruct the values after rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](fig5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For training, two images of the same scene are passed through the renderer. Then, the 3D transformation grid is applied in the representation space to turn one into the other, before passing them to the inverse renderer. Finally, the output images are compared to the original inputs to obtain the loss values. Training in this manner ensures the model learns equivariant representations, as the loss evaluates both the actual rendering and the accuracy of the matching transformations from both spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](fig4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the authors claim that the rendering loss used makes little change in results. They provide l1 norm, l2 norm and SSIM loss as candidates, and conduct ablation studies to determine the tradeoffs between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3: Datasets\n",
    "The authors evaluate their model on 4 datasets, including two ShapeNet benchmarks as well as two novel datasets of the authors design.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They use an image size of 128 x 128 and a representation size of 64 x 32 x 32 x 32.\n",

    "The qualitative comparisons against the baseline models in single shot novel view synthesis with the ShapeNet chairs dataset reveals that the model achieves similar to SoTA results while making far fewer assumptions than the other methods. It can produce high quality novel views by achieving the desired equivariant transformation in representation space.\n",

    "Much of the success of Deep Learning can be attributed to effective representation learning. Such representations do not need to be humanly interpretable, but can also be abstract. The original authors proposed an implicit 3D representation of the scene, instead of an explicit 3D representation such as mesh-grids or point clouds. By removing the need for an explicit 3D representation, they developed a model that requires no 3D supervision. It only requires 2D images with the corresponding rotation angle of the camera, that was used between these images. Their model can generate a novel view from a single image. The qualitative results of their model’s performance motivated us to extent their research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original paper the authors used 3D rotations to generate novel views, meaning that they rotate a camera on a sphere around the scene. 3D rotations do not act transitively on 3D space. Therefore, we proposed to extend their model to roto-translations, with the intermediate proof-of-concept step of using translations only. The objective was to obtain a model that can generate a novel view for any camera position in 3D space, within a reasonable range of movement."
