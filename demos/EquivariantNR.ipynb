    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper from Dupont et al. introduces an approach to render 2D images into implicit, equivariant 3D representations. The authors argue that the scene representations need not be explicit, as long as the transformations to it occur in an equivariant manner. Their model is trained on a dataset of rotation symmetries, learning to produce novel views from a single image of a scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current approaches in scene representations present difficulties with scalability. Voxel grids, point clouds and other traditional methods have high computational and memory requirements. Reconstrucion from incomplete or noisy data is also a challenging task with these methods, often requiring 3D information during training. Generating novel views of a scene given some input views presents the same difficulties. Finally, traditional neural networks are not equivariant with respect to general transformation groups. 3D equivariance especially requires specifc techniques like steerable filters. The authors attempt to solve these problems by proposing a new method which results in more scalable, implicit representations that are also equivariant with respect to transformations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between an explicit scene representation (mesh grid) and an implicit one can be seen in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](../src/imgs/paper_screenshots/fig2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 1.1: Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed model uses a series of convolutions to map scene representations to images. Specifically, the scene representation is passed through 3D convolutions, followed by 1x1 convolutions and a set of 2D convolutions that maps them to image space. The reverse renderer is the transpose of this operation. Equivariance is enforced by applying transformations in both the scene and image spaces. Because the representation space is a deep voxel grid, the transformations in this space are defined by a 3D rotation matrix. Inverse warping with trilinear interpolation is also used in the model, to reconstruct the values after rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](../src/imgs/paper_screenshots/fig5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For training, two images of the same scene are passed through the renderer. Then, the 3D transformation grid is applied in the representation space to turn one into the other, before passing them to the inverse renderer. Finally, the output images are compared to the original inputs to obtain the loss values. Training in this manner ensures the model learns equivariant representations, as the loss evaluates both the actual rendering and the accuracy of the matching transformations from both spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](../src/imgs/paper_screenshots/fig4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the authors claim that the rendering loss used makes little change in results. They provide l1 norm, l2 norm and SSIM loss as candidates, and conduct ablation studies to determine the tradeoffs between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2: Datasets\n",
    "The authors evaluate their model on 4 datasets, including two ShapeNet benchmarks as well as two novel datasets of the authors design. They use an image size of 128 x 128 and the deep voxel grid (i.e., the implicit scene representation) has a size of 64 x 32 x 32 x 32.\n",
    "The datasets are presented in Table 1. Per scene, multiple images are taken, each from a different camera angle.\n",

    "## 2. Response \n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the success of Deep Learning can be attributed to effective representation learning. Such representations do not need to be humanly interpretable, but can also be abstract. The original authors proposed an implicit 3D representation of the scene, instead of an explicit 3D representation such as mesh-grids or point clouds. By removing the need for an explicit 3D representation, they developed a model that requires no 3D supervision. It only requires 2D images with the corresponding relative rotation angle of the camera, that was used between these images. Their model can generate a novel view from a different angle, given a single image. The qualitative results of their model’s performance motivated us to extent their research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original paper, the authors used 3D rotations to generate novel views, meaning that they rotate a camera on a sphere around the scene. 3D rotations do not act transitively on 3D space. Therefore, we proposed to extend their model to roto-translations, with the intermediate proof-of-concept step of using translations only. Roto-translations act transitively on 3D space, meaning that we can produce any possible camera angle. The full spectrum of rigid body motions are nescessary to produce satisfactory renderings of real world environments. For instance in applications such as virtual and agumented reality, and 3D reconstruction. Hence, we hope to obtain a model that can generate a novel view for any camera position in 3D space, within a reasonable range of movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What can the model do and what is missing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The model, which was trained by the original authors, shows some nice out-of-the-box capabilities. That is the model can already perform some limited (roto-)translations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Translations through inductive bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Through inductive bias, (reasonably small) translations, which are orthogonal to the line of sight, already work on the model that has only been trained on rotations. This is due to the fact that the model uses a CNN architecture, which is translationally equivariant along the image plane. Due to the weight sharing property of the convolution kernels, a CNN will generally use the same encoding for the two images, where one is a shifted version of the other, but with the same shift applied to the encoding. The same goes for the decoder (i.e. neural renderer) which will produce the same rendered image for a shifted reprensentation. Therefore, the model acts translationally equivariant for these kinds of shifts. Still, it seems interesting that the model does not seem to encode any information from the outside of the object to produce a good estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](../src/imgs/paper_screenshots/translational_eq_cnn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Illustration of translational equivariance in CNNs (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/9/3161). Shifting the input and encoding it is equivalent to shifting encoding the input and shifting the encoding.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, translations along the line of sight do not work out-of-the-box and require explicit training. The reason for that is that the equivariant neural rendering model considers the depth dimension via incorporating its information into the channels of the CNN. More concrete, the model uses the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reshape 3D -> 2D\n",
    "reshaped = inputs.view(batch_size, channels * depth, height, width)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, due to the central positioning of the objects in the images, the model has problems rendering scenes that extent to the image boundaries. "

    "Another problem with out-of-the-box translations from the rotation model is that it only shifts the 2D image instead of developing a real 3D understanding of the scene. When we compare the rendered image to the ground truth, we observe that the model does not grasp that a shift also changes the angle at which the camera is looking at the object. It is obvious because the model has never seen a shift and only works on 2D equivariance as described above.

We produced a translation dataset for the model to learn how to deal with more extensive shifts of the camera, as well as learning how to deal with shifts of any size along the line of sight. Because the depth dimension is encoded within the channels of the convolution layers, it is plausible that the model can learn to make use of this information to produce a zoom-like effect, similar to which one would expect when moving the camera closer to the object.\n",

    "The motivation for our research was to extend the equivariant neural rendering model to be able to produce novel views for any camera position in 3D space. Roto-translations fulfill this requirement. More specifically, we can cover all 3D positions by limiting the azimuth angle to a range of -180 to 180 degrees and the elevation angle to a range of -90 to 90 degrees. The latter avoids a flipping of the camera which causes problems with the compatibility of translations in Blender vs translations in the model. Nonetheless, by being able to rotate the camera along the azimuth, we can still cover all necessary views. For translations, we can obviously only cover a finite distances, therefore we chose the same range as in section 3.2 (-0.5 to 0.5 for all directions).\n",
